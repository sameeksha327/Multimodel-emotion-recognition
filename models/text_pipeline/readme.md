Steps performed:

Generated text sentences from emotion labels in filenames

Tokenized text data using a tokenizer

Converted text into padded sequences

Built a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model

Trained the model to classify emotions

Evaluated model performance

Result:

Text Model Accuracy: 100%

The high accuracy occurred because emotion keywords were present in the generated text data.
